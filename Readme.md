## Background

<img src="pics_01/1.jpg" alt="Chatbot Screenshot" width="1200"/>
Gujarat has established itself as a pioneer in fostering innovation and entrepreneurship. The state houses numerous research institutions, start-ups, and innovation hubs that drive economic growth and technological advancement. However, the current systems for monitoring research activities, managing intellectual property rights (IPR), tracking innovation development, and overseeing start-up growth are fragmented and inefficient. The information is scattered across different organizations and departments, leading to difficulties in data accessibility, transparency, resource allocation, and overall management.
